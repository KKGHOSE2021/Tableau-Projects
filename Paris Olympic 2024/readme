In this project, the representation of the Paris Olympics that took place from July 26 to August 11, 2024, will be analysed with a high-level overview. Through exploratory data analysis, this project will figure out the number of participating countries, total participants in various events, and success rates of top nations in converting number of medals from the number of participants. It will also demonstrate the age group among the participants and the gender ratios among the athletes and medalists.
